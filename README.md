## Abstract
Trek is an innovative web application that transcends traditional location-based media sharing by allowing users to discover and share content tied to a location without it necessarily being about that location.

Differentiating itself from platforms like Google Maps, Snap Maps and AllTrails, Trek offers a unique feature where content shared is reflective of the interests of people at a specific location rather than the location itself. This gives users a window into the collective interests of a place, be it a university, a bustling city square, or a serene hiking trail. With Trek, we aim to create opportunities for users to connect with others in their vicinity, not by chance, but through shared passions and interests.

## Introduction
While existing platforms provide glimpses into the activities or sights of a location, Trek's mission is to connect people through the content they cherish. This could range from a thought-provoking article to a song that resonates with the spirit of a place. By mandating that users be physically present to post content, Trek ensures authenticity and a genuine reflection of the location's current vibe.

## Problem Statement
In a world where physical paths cross countless times a day, there is a missed opportunity for individuals to connect with those around them who share common interests.

Traditional social platforms have not capitalized on this aspect of connection; they often either operate on a global scale or focus too narrowly on specific location details without fostering personal interactions.

Trek seeks to fill this void by enabling individuals to discover and connect with like-minded people in their immediate surroundings through shared content, transforming fleeting proximity into lasting connections.

## Current Solutions
Platforms like Google Maps and Snap Maps provide location-based content sharing, but the content is often limited to being about the place itself. Trek innovates by curating a feed of diverse media shared by individuals in specific locations, reflecting a broader spectrum of interests that may or may not be related to the place they are pinned to.

## Proposed Solution

Trek is a cutting-edge platform that merges the concept of a content feed with geographic locations. Here's how it will redefine the way we interact with our surroundings and each other:

- Users are enabled to contribute a variety of content—ranging from links, music, images, to videos—to content-feed 'pins' on the map, but only when they are physically present at that actual 'pin' location. This mechanism ensures that the shared content is a genuine reflection of what people in that locale find interesting and want to share.
- The map features content-feed pins in diverse settings—everything from conventional urban locations like universities and malls, to off-the-beaten-path places like hiking trails.
- While browsing is unrestricted, allowing users to view content from any corner of the globe, contribting is deliberately limited to physical presence. This unique approach keeps the local feeds authentic and deeply connected to the pulse of each place.
- Trek is about discovering people. By offering a platform for users to connect with those nearby who share similar tastes—whether it's a love for the same music, art, or news—Trek paves the way for serendipitous connections and meaningful, potentially lifelong connections, with people of similar interests and tastes as you—it helps you find YOUR PEOPLE!


## Target Audience
Trek is designed for anyone seeking to discover and connect with like-minded individuals in their immediate environment, from students and travelers to local residents and outdoor enthusiasts.

## Project Scope
The scope of Trek extends to a fully interactive web application featuring user authentication, location verification, real-time content sharing, and robust user profiles that foster connections based on shared content preferences.

We believe the scope is certainly large enough for the work to be split nicely amongst five group members.

## Features and Epics
- Content-feed 'pins' on a map in diverse locations, from universities to hiking trails.
- Location verification: Ensuring content is posted by users who are physically present at the location.
- Feeds include books, songs, videos, articles, personal thoughts, links—essentially content of any kind.
- Social Connection: User profiles that allow for connections based on mutual interests in content.

## User Stories
- As a university student, I want to share my favorite podcast episode on the campus pin so that I can connect with fellow students who share my interests.
- As an avid hiker, I want to post the music I listen to while on the trail to share the soundtrack of my adventure with others who hike the same path.
- As someone new to the city, I want to explore the local content feed to find others with similar tastes and potentially make new friends.

## Technology Overview
Trek will be a desktop web app built with a React front-end for a smooth and responsive user experience. The back-end will use Springboot with a PostgreSQL database.

Data storage for things like photos and videos will be handled using Cloudflare Stream and Cloudflare Images.

For the map, we will be using the Google Maps API.

## Conclusion
Trek reimagines social connectivity by transforming shared digital content into pathways for real-world connections. It's more than an app—it's a social compass guiding users to discover kindred spirits in the tapestry of everyday locales, by intertwining physical presence with shared passions.

With Trek, every place tells a story, vibe, and pulse of the people that inhabit it, and, as a participant, enables you to find "your people" at each place.
